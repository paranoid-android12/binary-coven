# Phaser.js Implementation Improvements

## Summary
This document outlines the improvements made to follow Phaser.js best practices and prevent memory leaks.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Moved Animations to Preloader Scene (COMPLETED)

**Problem:** Animations were being created in the `ProgrammingGame` scene's `create()` method, which meant they were recreated every time the scene was loaded. This is inefficient and can cause conflicts.

**Solution:** 
- Moved all animation creation to `Preloader.ts` scene's `create()` method
- Moved all spritesheet loading to `Preloader.ts` scene's `preload()` method
- Animations are now created once globally and available across all scenes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/game/scenes/Preloader.ts` - Added spritesheet loading and animation creation
- `src/game/scenes/ProgrammingGame.ts` - Removed duplicate loading/animation code

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Follows Phaser best practice (create animations once in Preloader)
- ✅ Better performance (no redundant animation creation)
- ✅ Cleaner code organization
- ✅ Animations available globally across all scenes

**Code Changes:**`
```typescript
// Before: In ProgrammingGame.ts
preload() {
  this.load.spritesheet('qubit_walk', 'Walk.png', {...});
  this.load.spritesheet('qubit_idle', 'Idle.png', {...});
  // ... more loading
}

create() {
  this.createAnimations(); // Created every scene load
}

// After: In Preloader.ts
preload() {
  // All spritesheets loaded here once
  this.load.spritesheet('qubit_walk', 'Walk.png', {...});
  this.load.spritesheet('qubit_idle', 'Idle.png', {...});
}

create() {
  this.createQubitAnimations(); // Created once globally
  this.scene.start('MainMenu');
}
```

### 2. ✅ Added Sprite Cleanup System (COMPLETED)

**Problem:** When entities or grids were removed from the game state, their corresponding Phaser sprites, progress bars, and other visual elements were not being destroyed. This causes memory leaks.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive cleanup methods in `ProgrammingGame.ts`
- Added EventBus events for entity/grid removal
- Connected cleanup listeners to automatically destroy sprites when state is removed
- Added scene shutdown lifecycle method

**Files Modified:**
- `src/game/scenes/ProgrammingGame.ts` - Added cleanup methods and listeners
- `src/stores/gameStore.ts` - Added EventBus emissions on removal
- `src/game/EventBus.ts` - (Already existed, used for events)

**New Methods Added:**

1. **`cleanupEntitySprite(entityId: string)`**
   - Destroys entity sprite
   - Destroys associated progress bar
   - Destroys associated progress text
   - Removes from sprite maps

2. **`cleanupGridSprite(gridId: string)`**
   - Destroys grid sprite
   - Destroys wheat sprites (if farmland)
   - Destroys associated progress bar
   - Destroys associated progress text
   - Removes from sprite maps

3. **`cleanupAllSprites()`**
   - Destroys all entity sprites
   - Destroys all grid sprites
   - Destroys all wheat sprites
   - Destroys all progress bars
   - Destroys all progress texts
   - Clears all sprite maps

4. **`shutdown()`**
   - Scene lifecycle method
   - Calls cleanupAllSprites()
   - Removes all EventBus listeners
   - Prevents memory leaks when scene is destroyed

**Event Flow:**
```
GameStore.removeEntity(id) 
  → EventBus.emit('entity-removed', id)
    → ProgrammingGame.cleanupEntitySprite(id)
      → sprite.destroy() ✓
      → progressBar.destroy() ✓
      → All cleaned up!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents memory leaks
- ✅ Proper Phaser object lifecycle management
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when state changes
- ✅ Scene shutdown cleanup
- ✅ Follows Phaser best practices

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the improvements work correctly:

1. **Test Animation Loading:**
   ```
   - Start the game
   - Check console for: "[PRELOADER] Qubit animations created successfully"
   - Check console for: "[PRELOADER] All animations created globally"
   - Verify qubit animations play correctly in game
   ```

2. **Test Sprite Cleanup:**
   ```
   - Remove an entity using gameStore.removeEntity(id)
   - Check console for: "[STORE] Removed entity: ..."
   - Check console for: "[CLEANUP] Cleaning up sprite for entity: ..."
   - Check console for: "[CLEANUP] Entity sprite cleanup complete: ..."
   - Verify sprite disappears from screen
   ```

3. **Test Scene Shutdown:**
   ```
   - Change scenes in the game
   - Check console for: "[SCENE] ProgrammingGame shutting down - cleaning up resources"
   - Check console for: "[CLEANUP] All sprites cleaned up"
   - Check console for: "[SCENE] ProgrammingGame shutdown complete"
   ```

## Performance Impact

**Before:**
- Animations created multiple times (once per scene load)
- Sprites never destroyed (memory leak over time)
- EventBus listeners accumulate (potential issues)

**After:**
- Animations created once (better memory usage)
- Sprites properly destroyed (no memory leaks)
- EventBus listeners cleaned up (better performance)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Lower memory usage
- ✅ No memory leaks from sprites
- ✅ Faster scene transitions
- ✅ Better long-term stability

## Additional Improvements to Consider (Future)

While we implemented the quick wins, here are additional improvements for the future:

1. **Texture Atlas System** (Medium Priority)
   - Combine multiple spritesheets into single texture atlas
   - Reduces HTTP requests
   - Better memory efficiency

2. **Prefab System** (High Priority)
   - Data-driven entity creation
   - Easier to add new sprites/animations
   - More maintainable code

3. **Container-Based Entities** (Medium Priority)
   - Use Phaser.GameObjects.Container for grouped sprites
   - Easier management of multi-sprite entities
   - Better organization

4. **Event-Driven Rendering** (Low Priority)
   - Remove periodic updateVisuals() calls
   - Use dirty flags and event-driven updates
   - Better performance

## Best Practices Now Followed

✅ **Animations created in Preloader** - Global animation creation  
✅ **Sprites properly destroyed** - No memory leaks  
✅ **Scene lifecycle managed** - shutdown() method  
✅ **Event-driven cleanup** - Automatic sprite removal  
✅ **Proper resource management** - All Phaser objects cleaned up

## Conclusion

These improvements bring the codebase in line with Phaser.js best practices and prevent memory leaks. The implementation is clean, maintainable, and follows industry standards for Phaser development.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - No linter errors, all tests passing
